<h1>The Blackjack Project<h/1>

<h2>Overview<h/2>

<p>This is our fourth project for this cohort, in which we aim to create an application that simulates the game of Blackjack. The objective of the game is for multiple players to bet against the house on who can get closer to 21 or achieve a score of 21 in their first try. In our project, we will create an application with two players, including the dealer.</p>

<h3>Rules of the game</h3>

<p>In the first round, the players and the house are dealt two cards each. Each player can decide to "Stand," meaning they do not want more cards, or "Hit" as many times as they want. All the players' cards are visible at all times, and in the first round, only the second card of the house is visible. If a player surpasses the score of 21, they are automatically disqualified. If a player gets an ace and a ten, it results in an automatic win, unless the house also draws an ace and a ten, resulting in a draw between the player and the house. Once all players have stood, hit, or disqualified, the house is required to continue drawing until its score is equal to or greater than 17. In this game, all players can win, draw, or lose, and if all players lose, the house automatically wins without drawing any cards. If a player or the house scores 21 with an ace and a ten, it is considered a "Blackjack," and this person is the winner, even if all scores are the same.</p>

<h2>Tech<h/2>

<h3>Our application will be developed using the following</h3>

<ol>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>Stack Overflow as a resource</li>
<li>Washington Post Games Section for comparison purposes</li>
</ol>

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>

<p>This project has been one of our most challenging to date. We have incorporated lessons learned from the first week to the current stage, making it a mix of all our learning experiences. One of the biggest challenges we faced was incorporating while loops without creating an infinite loop</p>
